 Rebuild Solution Failing
--------------------------
On Rebuild Solution, visual studio seems to be throwing an error - Could not create folder.
Culprit seems to be following command in post-build steps:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Playdate\bin\pdc" -sdkpath "C:/Program Files (x86)/Playdate" "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/<Game Name>/Source" "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/<Game Name>/<Game Name>.pdx"

To fix it, I had to remove the output folder before calling the pdc exe.
So I added following line, right before it:
rmdir /s /q "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/Particles/<Game Name>.pdx"

Checkout custom_post_build.txt for full script.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Build Solution would fail if Playdate Simulator is running the output .pdx file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically I had to kill PlaydateSimulator.exe if it is running before kicking off new build.
To fix that, I added pre-build step as provided in custom_pre_build.txt

 Getting rid of cmake 
----------------------
Replaced hardcoded paths in project building steps with relative paths, so now I can clone the repo and VS project would build out fine regardless of which directory I'm cloning it to. 

Make sure you have following two installed though!
 CMake at C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe
 Playdate SDK 1.7.0 at C:\Program Files (x86)\Playdate\
