# All The Sheep

Cloned using Hello World c project from [Playdate SDK 1.7.0](https://devforum.play.date/)

/build: Visual Studio Solution files\
/src: C code\
/docs: Other project related documentation

Use Debug config to build the solution - haven't tried Release yet! Output would be a pdx file placed under root of this directory. The pdx can be run using PlaydateSimulator which is part of SDK 1.7.0
