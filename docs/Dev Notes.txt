 Rebuild Solution Failing
--------------------------
On Rebuild Solution, visual studio seems to be throwing an error - Could not create folder.
Culprit seems to be following command in post-build steps:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Playdate\bin\pdc" -sdkpath "C:/Program Files (x86)/Playdate" "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/<Game Name>/Source" "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/<Game Name>/<Game Name>.pdx"

To fix it, I had to remove the output folder before calling the pdc exe.
So I added following line, right before it:
rmdir /s /q "C:/Users/Neesarg/Developer/Playdate/Examples SDK 1.7/Particles/<Game Name>.pdx"

Checkout custom_post_build.txt for full script.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Build Solution would fail if Playdate Simulator is running the output .pdx file
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basically I had to kill PlaydateSimulator.exe if it is running before kicking off new build.
To fix that, I added pre-build step as provided in custom_pre_build.txt
